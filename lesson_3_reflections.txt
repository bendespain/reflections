When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want a backup, or when I want to share with friends or such.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you could unknowingly introduce conflicts and not be ready for them
