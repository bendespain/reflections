What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It sets up that directory as a git directory and enables tracking of files and the creation of branches.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is a tracked area, whereas working directory is not.  It is not quite when things are in the repository, it's right before the commit.  I think the staging area helps you prepare for what actually will be committed and therefore makes it clear what will and what won't be committed

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Use git diff --staged to see the differences in the last commit and what you're about to commit.  Then finalize decision if it's logical.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	They would help when I am experimenting on my own version of things and I don't want to mess with the master that others are working on. Branches keep my stuff separate from the main, or others' stuff.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	Like a tree they help me realize where things are rooted, or originate
