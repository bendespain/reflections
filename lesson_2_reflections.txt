What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It sets up that directory as a git directory and enables tracking of files and the creation of branches.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is a tracked area, whereas working directory is not.  It is not quite when things are in the repository, it's right before the commit.  I think the staging area helps you prepare for what actually will be committed and therefore makes it clear what will and what won't be committed
